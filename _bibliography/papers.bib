  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {Tremendous progress has been made in facial Micro-Expression (ME) spotting and recognition; however, most works have focused on either spotting or recognition tasks on the 2D videos. Until recently, the estimation of the 3D motion field (a.k.a scene flow) for the ME has only become possible after the release of the multi-modal ME dataset. In this paper, we propose the first Scene Flow Attention-based Micro-expression Network, namely SFAMNet. It takes the scene flow computed using the RGB-D flow algorithm as the input and predicts the spotting confidence score and emotion labels. Specifically, SFAMNet is an attention-based end-to-end multi-stream multi-task network devised to spot and recognize the ME. Besides that, we present a data augmentation strategy to alleviate the small sample size problem during network learning. Extensive experiments are performed on three tasks: (i) ME spotting; (ii) ME recognition; and (iii) ME analysis on the multi-modal CAS(ME)^3 dataset. Empirical results indicate that depth is vital in capturing the ME information and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

  abstract = {Detecting moiré patterns in digital photographs is meaningful as it provides priors towards image quality evaluation and demoiréing tasks. In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient framework to extract moiré edge maps from images with moiré patterns. The framework includes a strategy for training triplet (natural image, moiré layer, and their synthetic mixture) generation, and a Moiré Pattern Detection Neural Network (MoireDet) for moiré edge map estimation. This strategy ensures consistent pixel-level alignments during training, accommodating characteristics of a diverse set of camera-captured screen images and real-world moiré patterns from natural images. The design of three encoders in MoireDet exploits both high-level contextual and low-level structural features of various moiré patterns. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of MoireDet: better identification precision of moiré images on two datasets, and a marked improvement over state-of-the-art demoiréing methods.},
