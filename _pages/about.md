Welcome to the Multimedia Data Analysis (MuDA) Lab! MuDA Lab is aa research group started in 2022, headed by [Dr. John See](https://johnsee.net). We are based in [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/malaysia/) (Malaysia campus), and we work closely with collaborators from the [Visual Processing Lab (MMU)](https://viprlab.github.io) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://weiyaolin.github.io). 

<b>Research statement:</b> Our principal research interests lie in the advancement of multimedia signal processing particularly in discovering new methodologies and techniques in emotional analysis and multimodal systems, for solving real-world problems in various applications such as micro-expression detection, human-robot interaction, multimodal content generation, and more.
